# UFOs

## Overview
McMinnville Oregon is famous for it sightings and UFOs and Dana, a local data journalist wants write an article about it.

We have a starting JavaScript file with data of countries, cities, states, type of sighting. Throughout JavaScriptâ€™s visual functionality we will display the data as a table, then adding filters and finally posting it online.

## Results

First, we built a dynamic web application by utilizing javascript and html.

We transformed the JavaScript data file into a readable table, which contains every sighting sort by date.

Then, to allow more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, we inserted table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

So the readers can search the sightings related by any of these categories either each one alaone or all the filters at once. The readers should enter the information all in lower case and with the data format mm/dd/yyyy.

## Summary

The dynamic we application is a huge improvement in the visualization of UFO data, but there are some drawbacks from this first code developed that can be addressed for future improvements. Like having the same style of table as the result of a search can be a plain interaction with the readers. For future development there could be personalized return messages for each search; such as, counters to summarize the total results for each search, f.e. "5 sighting found for 'el cajon'" or even an error message when entering a city with no results "no results found for new york city".

Also an improvement on the design could help the readers to visualize and better understand the data. And finally, adding buttons to clear the search or to refresh can make easier the user experience.
